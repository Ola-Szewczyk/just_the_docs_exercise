As a technical writer, you will have to deal with an unresponsive SME. Here are some tips and tricks for meeting deadlines in unfavorable conditions.

**Be prepared**

Do you know what you need from your SME? It’s always good to be prepared. You'll feel more confident, but you’ll also be able to collect more information. Your being prepared will also make it more difficult for the SME to dismiss you before you get exactly what you need.

-   Make sure you gather the accessible information before the interview - search for existing sources of knowledge. Read. Analyze. Have your point of view.
-   Show your SME that you already know what you’re writing about. Asking for general information may make them even less cooperative.
-   Prepare the list of questions or topics and use it during the meeting - cover as many as possible.

**Get to know your SME**

Having your SME find the time for an interview may be challenging. Fortunately, you can minimize the time you need by interviewing the team first. Talk to people who work closely with your SME - they may provide you with most, or even all, the information you need.

Use your SME’s team to gather clues on how to approach them and have them find the time for you in the future.

**Straight to the point**

Score some points by asking straightforward questions. Have you prepared the list mentioned above? It should be enough to keep you on the track. Stick to it and try to avoid digressions. Have your topics prioritized and make sure you get the answers in the shortest possible amount of time.

**Change your methods**

Sometimes you just have to be creative. If your emails get lost in the crowd, it may be a good time to try something new.

Think about setting up a virtual lunch or coffee - it’ll be less formal, but it may give you some answers or at least create the foundation for future meetings.

Face-to-face meeting seems impossible? Join team meetings. They may be very informative and could help your SME realize why a well-informed technical writer is such an important part of the project.
